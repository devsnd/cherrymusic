""" Dependency injection and other facilities to match providers of services
    with their users.

    Nature and interface of a service are left for the concerned parties to
    agree on; all this module knows about the service is its name, or "handle".

    Basic usage::

        >>> pizza = object()
        >>> service.provide('pizzaservice', pizza)
        >>> pizza is service.get('pizzaservice')
        True

    Types as providers and users::

        >>> class PizzaService(object):
        ...     pass
        ...
        >>> @service.user(mypizza='pizzaservice')     # become a user
        ... class PizzaUser(object):
        ...     pass
        ...
        >>> user = PizzaUser()
        >>> service.provide('pizzaservice', PizzaService)
        >>> isinstance(user.mypizza, PizzaService)    # provider as attribute
        True

    that's also part of the cycle, a singularity is spawned which implodes the
    universe. This exception is raised to prevent that.

    In general, don't create cyclic dependencies. It's bad for your brain and
