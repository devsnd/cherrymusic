Getting Started
---------------

1. [We're on github](https://github.com/devsnd/cherrymusic). Checkout or download the cherrymusic sources, e.g.:

        $ git clone git://github.com/devsnd/cherrymusic.git
    
2. To use cherrymusic you need [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org). There are two options:
    - Install it. Use your favorite package manager,
      or [download](http://download.cherrypy.org/cherrypy/3.2.2/) it and do a manual install.
    - If you only want to test cherrymusic without installing any dependencies, you
      can simply start CherryMusic and it will ask you if you want it to install
      cherrypy in the local folder for you.


3. Now simply run the main script using python 3; it will prompt you for anything else.

        $ python cherrymusic

4. On first start: The server creates a config file for you. 
   Make the necessary changes and restart the server.

5. Open your browser and play some music!

        $ firefox localhost:8080

Known Issues
------------

An active flash blocker can interfere with the web frontend. 
If you have trouble with things like track selection or playback, try whitelisting
the server in your browser's flash blocker / plugin manager.

On Windows:
```
FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified: 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\.cherrymusic\
\sessions\\session-622d41384b5f877a840ba5dfe38408dc4853e8f4.lock'
```
This error can be circumvented by setting the

        keep_session_in_ram = True

in the configuration file (`C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\cherrymusic\config`).
